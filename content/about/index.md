## What I Do Professionally

I am a Software Engineer focused in platforms like Kubernetes. My focus and passion has always been around writing code to automate the termoil and solve practical problems for developers.

I'm incredibly quick to pick up new technologies and am a life long learner in the field. This combined with my strong interpersonal skills make me a solid addition to any team.

## What I do Personally

### Linux

In my free time I am enthusiastic about Linux. I've been using Linux as my primary operating system on my personal computers for about a decade now. It began with a [homelab](https://linuxhandbook.com/homelab/) I set up while
I was still in university and eventually took over as my favorite OS for "just getting things done".

### Keyboards

In 2013 I bought my first mechnical keyboard which was a pre-built steelseries with black switches. Ever since then I've never gone back to non-mechanical for my personal setups. The more and more years go by the more I've learned
about all the interesting odds and ends of mechanical keyboards. At this point in time I have more than I can keep track of in my head and have had the joy of even getting to build some of them. More details about all of my keyboards
can be found in my post [HERE](/posts/keyboards).

### Neovim

I've been a big fan of Vim for as long as I've been using Linux and it has always been my go to. But recently I've switched to using Neovim and exploring all the functionality it can gather from plugins. I find a lot of joy in getting the "full IDE experience"
while opting into the features I care about only. You can see my current configuration on [Github](https://github.com/michohl/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim)

## Where I Went to School

I received a B.A. in Computer Science from the [University of Northern Iowa](https://chas.uni.edu/cs) in 2019.
